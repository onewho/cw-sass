      A latte (shortened form of the Italian caffe latte, meaning "coffee milk") is a
      coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Calling people latte drinkers has become a common political attack in Western cultures.
      The popularity of espresso drinking in large cities, especially among populations that
      are liberal advocates of pushing urban leftist policies onto those outside of big
      cities and to blue-collar workers, has caused some to consider it elitist behavior.

    <p class="text">
      A cappuccino is a coffee drink topped with foamed milk. It is made in a
      steam-producing espresso machine. Espresso is poured into the bottom third of the cup,
      followed by a similar amount of hot milk. The top third of the drink consists of milk
      foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk,
      called latte art.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      In a traditional cappuccino, as served in Europe and artisan coffee houses in the
      United States, the total of espresso and milk/foam make up between approximately
      150-180 mL (5-6 US fl oz). Crappy coffee chains in the US more often serve
      the cappuccino as a 360 mL (12 US fl oz) drink or larger.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
      A cappuccino should not have sugar or chocolate in it. The drink should never
      be more than 6oz. If someone orders a 12oz cappuccino, they are actually
      getting a latte. I think they just like to say the word
      <em>cappuccino</em> to feel fancy.

    <p class="text">
      A cortado is an espresso cut with a small amount of warm milk. The ratio of
      milk to coffee is between 1:1 - 1:2, and the milk is added after the espresso.
      The word "cortado" is from the Spanish cortar, to cut.

    <p class="text">
      It is also commonly called a "Gibraltar" in the United States, especially on
      the West Coast. The name Gibraltar originates in San Francisco, California,
      where roasters such as Blue Bottle Coffee Company and Ritual Coffee Roasters
      started the trend by serving the drink in Libbey-Owens-Ford glassware by the
      same name.

    <blockquote class="quote">
      However a cortado is made, it should be distinguished from the Italian caffe
      macchiato or cappuccino.

      Caffe macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is a coffee drink, made out of
      espresso with a small amount of milk. 'Macchiato' simply means 'marked' or 'stained',
      and in the case of caffe macchiato, this means literally 'espresso stained/marked
      with milk'. Traditionally it is made with one shot of espresso, and the small amount
      of added milk was the 'stain'.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      The reason this coffee drink got its name was that the baristas needed to show the
      serving waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit
      of milk in it; the latter was 'marked'. In the United States, 'macchiato' is more
      likely to describe latte macchiato, thus arises the common confusion that 'macchiato'
      literally means 'foam', or that a macchiato must necessarily have foam.

    <blockquote class="quote">
      What <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a> serves you is not a macchiato.
      It's just an upside down latte (probably with a bunch of caramel and whipped cream).
      If you order a macchiato at a real cafe, expect a 4oz drink.

      Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly
      boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso often has
      a thicker consistency than coffee brewed by other methods, a higher concentration of
      suspended and dissolved solids, and crema (meaning cream, but being a reference to
      the foam with a creamy texture that forms as a result of the pressure).
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground,
      compacted coffee. Tamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration
      of the grounds. This process produces an almost syrupy beverage by extracting
      both solid and dissolved components. It also produces the definitive crema, by
      emulsifying the oils in the ground coffee into a colloid, which does not occur in
      other brewing methods.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
      Most modern specialty cafe's serve only a double espresso, the volume of which is
      generally between 1oz and 2oz.
